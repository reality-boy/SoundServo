# SoundServo
Drive two rc servos with sound from a web page

 Allows you to control two RC servo motors via the audio headphone jack on
 your tablet or phone.

 You need to wire your servos to a power source (2-4 AA batterys work fine)
 You also need to hook the control line of the servos to the left and right outputs
 from the headphone jack.  Don't forget to hook the grounds together as well.

Using a small amplifier will help this work more reliably on all devices.  If you don't use an amp then you need to turn the volume up all the way on your device.
