# SoundServo
Drive two rc servos with sound from a web page

 Allows you to control two RC servo motors via the audio headphone jack on
 your tablet or phone.

 You need to wire your servos to a power source (2-4 AA batterys work fine)
 You also need to hook the control line of the servos to the left and right outputs
 from the headphone jack.  Don't forget to hook the grounds together as well.

Using a small amplifier will help this work more reliably on all devices.  If you don't use an amp then you need to turn the volume up all the way on your device.

I'm not sure where this was left, but I know it worked at one point in time. I have this setup for a 5 bar configuration with the original intention of coming up with a very low cost 3d printed robot arm that could draw simple pictures. The idea was to make a robot for less than $20 that kids in a robot club could build themselves and take home.

By using a web page to control the robot any computer or phone can be the controller, saving you money. The cost then is a few screws, a pair of $3 servos, an audio cable, 4 cell AA battery holder, and a few 3D printed pieces.

I got stuck both on my 3D modeling skills, and my ability to work out the kinematics to produce smooth lines. I'm sure both issues can be overcome with a bit of effort.
